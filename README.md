### Featured Projects

- **Air Quality Brazil - Dashboard 🌎**  
  
  This repository hosts tools and data for monitoring air quality in Brazil. The dashboard serves as a visualization hub by aggregating data from various air quality networks, supporting research and increasing public awareness of air pollution trends and solutions.
  
  📊 About the Project  
  The Air Quality Brazil Dashboard is an interactive and dynamic platform built using Streamlit and Plotly. It provides visualizations such as graphs, maps, and filters to explore air quality data from different regions of Brazil.

  This dashboard currently features real data from Fortaleza, Ceará, provided by the MOQA Network – a collaboration between:  
  - TRAMA (Transport and Environment Laboratory) – UFC (Federal University of Ceará)  
  - CITINOVA – Foundation for Science, Technology, and Innovation of Fortaleza  
  - Fortaleza City Hall

- **Geocoding Tools**

  - **geocode-with-google** (Public): Automate geocoding of addresses from Excel files using Selenium WebDriver, with caching and logging for efficient data processing.
  - **geocode-with-nominatim** (Public): Efficient Python-based geocoding tool with local Nominatim server support, caching, and progress tracking for large datasets.

- **gps-temp-view** (Public)  
  ![GPS Temp View](/car-temperature.gif)  
  An Arduino project for urban heat island monitoring using ESP32, BME280 sensor, u-blox GPS, and SD card data logging.

- **pavevibe** (Public)  
  ![PaveVibe](/vibrating.gif)  
  PaveVibe: A georeferenced device leveraging ESP32, accelerometer, and GPS data to measure and map pavement quality, identifying defects for maintenance and infrastructure improvement.

- **Firestore Data Backup**  
  A robust solution for extracting and storing Firestore documents into a local SQLite database. It processes data hour by hour to minimize large requests to Firebase, keeping project costs low while allowing gradual backups of data.

  This project emphasizes flexibility and scalability, making it applicable to various Firebase projects. With customizable collection and timestamp fields, the tool ensures adaptability for different data schemas.
